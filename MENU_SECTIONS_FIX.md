# Menu Sections Fix - October 22, 2025

## Issue Summary

After implementing menu sections (changing from direct `menu_recipe` links to `menu -> menu_section -> menu_section_recipe`), the application stopped working with errors like:
- "Unable to refresh menu sections" on the ingredients page
- Recipe book and Menu not displaying anything
- API returning 500 Internal Server Error

## Root Cause

**The database schema was not updated to match the new code changes.**

You had:
1. ✅ Updated the models in `apps/api/app/models.py`
2. ✅ Updated the DAL functions in `apps/api/app/dal.py`
3. ✅ Updated the routes in `apps/api/app/routes.py`
4. ✅ Updated the frontend API client in `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`
5. ✅ Created an Alembic migration (`74c3b2166d1b`)
6. ❌ **But did NOT apply the migration to your database**

## The Fix

### 1. Applied Pending Migration ✅
```bash
cd apps/api
source venv/bin/activate
alembic upgrade head
```

This applied migration `74c3b2166d1b` which created:
- `menu_section` table
- `menu_section_recipe` table (replacing `menu_recipe`)
- Removed `menu_category` column from `recipe` table

### 2. Fixed SQLAlchemy Syntax Errors ✅

**Issue:** `nullsLast()` method doesn't exist in SQLAlchemy
```python
# WRONG (camelCase)
.order_by(MenuSection.position.nullsLast())

# CORRECT (snake_case)
.order_by(MenuSection.position.nulls_last())
```

**Fixed in:** `apps/api/app/dal.py` lines 873, 940

### 3. Fixed Pydantic v2 Syntax ✅

**Issue:** `from_orm()` is Pydantic v1 syntax
```python
# WRONG (Pydantic v1)
MenuSectionResponse.from_orm(section)

# CORRECT (Pydantic v2)
MenuSectionResponse.model_validate(section)
```

**Fixed in:** `apps/api/app/routes.py` lines 342, 379

## Testing Results

After applying all fixes:

✅ **API Health Check:** Working
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok","db_connected":true}
```

✅ **Menu Sections Endpoint:** Working
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/restaurants/5/menu-sections
# Returns menu with Archive section
```

✅ **Recipes Endpoint:** Working
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/recipes/restaurant/5
# Returns recipes with empty sections array
```

## What Was Added to Prevent Future Issues

Updated `/agents.md` with a **critical database migration workflow** section:

### Key Guidelines Added:

1. **Never edit models without creating a migration**
   - Changing `models.py` without Alembic migration causes runtime errors

2. **Always run migrations after pulling code**
   ```bash
   alembic current          # Check where you are
   alembic upgrade head     # Apply pending migrations
   ```

3. **SQLAlchemy Method Names**
   - Use `nulls_last()` not `nullsLast()` (snake_case)
   - Use `model_validate()` not `from_orm()` (Pydantic v2)

4. **Proper Migration Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Step-by-step process when changing models:
   1. Check current state: alembic current
   2. Make model changes in models.py
   3. Generate migration: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
   4. Review the generated migration file
   5. Apply migration: alembic upgrade head
   6. Verify: alembic current
   7. Restart API server
   ```

5. **Handling Multiple Heads**
   ```bash
   alembic merge -m "merge heads" <head1> <head2>
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Files Modified in This Fix

### Backend
1. `apps/api/app/dal.py` - Fixed `nullsLast()` → `nulls_last()`
2. `apps/api/app/routes.py` - Fixed `from_orm()` → `model_validate()`

### Documentation
1. `agents.md` - Added comprehensive database migration workflow section

### Database
- Applied migration `74c3b2166d1b` (add menu sections tables)

## Current Database State

```
Migration: 74c3b2166d1b (head)
New tables:
  - menu_section
  - menu_section_recipe
Removed columns:
  - recipe.menu_category
```

## Summary

This was NOT an Alembic issue per se, but rather a workflow issue where:
1. Code changes were made
2. Migration was created
3. **But migration was never applied to the database**

The disconnect between code (expecting new schema) and database (still on old schema) caused all the errors.

**The fix:** Simply run `alembic upgrade head` after making model changes or pulling code with migrations.

---

**Prevention:** Follow the workflow documented in `agents.md` every time you change database models.
